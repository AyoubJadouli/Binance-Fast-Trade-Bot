ANDROID INSTALLATION

WARNING: Remember to have the data activated and a good signal, if it is unstable or the connection is lost, the bot will lose information and therefore
You will lose purchase and sale data.

This guide is for versions from android 7 onwards .... (Termux is not compatible with versions prior to android 7)
To run our bot on android it is necessary to have the Termux application, for this we are going to download the f-droid apk (the Google Play version does not work)
https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/

Here is the direct link to the latest version (09/22/2021)
https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_117.apk

once downloaded we install it, it may be necessary to enable the option in android "Unknown sources" (this does not represent any risk for the cell phone)
Open the installed app and start updating the repositories, and installing the necessary package:

pkg update & pkg upgrade
pkg install openssh net-tools procps nano wget git python

update (updates repositories)
upgrade (upgrade packages)
openssh (remote access)
net-tools (find out IP)
procps (kill processes)
nano (to edit files)
wget (to download files from the internet)
git (to download the fork)
python (base language of the bot)

Start and stop SSH daemon
To start the daemon, that is, listen for connections, it is executed (Note: connections will be listened on port 8022):
sshd

To kill or stop him, you use:
pkill sshd

We are already listening for SSH connections, but we still don't know our username, password and IP.
Find out your username by typing:
whoami

Now give it a strong password by running:
passwd

Finally see what IP you have, typing:
ifconfig

When you have that data you can connect from another place. If you use linux in the client terminal execute:
ssh USER @ TU_IP -p 8022

From windows you can use Putty https://www.putty.org/ or install ssh for windows https://www.openssh.com/portable.html

we will clone the bot repository as follows in termux
git clone https://github.com/pantersxx3/Binance-Bot.git

then we write:
cd Binance-Bot

We update the necessary packages to run the bot as follows
pip3.9 install --upgrade pip
pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt


To periodically update the bot we execute the command:
git pull
